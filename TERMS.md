# Terms of Service

**Last Updated:** 1th of February 2026

By inviting **SocialStocks** ("the Bot") to your Discord server or using its features, you agree to these Terms of Service.

## 1. Usage License & Intellectual Property

The source code for SocialStocks is publicly available on GitHub for **transparency, audit, and educational purposes only**.

### 1.1 No Unauthorized Hosting
You are **NOT** permitted to host, deploy, or distribute a public instance of this software (e.g., a "clone" bot) that competes with the official SocialStocks instance without express written permission from the developer.

### 1.2 Personal Use
You may download and modify the code for private, personal learning or testing on a private local server, provided it is not made accessible to the general public.

### 1.3 Contributions
If you submit code contributions (Pull Requests) to the repository, you agree to license your contribution to the project owner for use in the official bot.

## 2. The Virtual Economy

SocialStocks simulates a stock market based on user activity metrics.

* **No Real World Value:** Currencies, stocks, "Net Worth," and portfolios tracked by the Bot are purely virtual. They have no monetary value and cannot be exchanged for real currency, tangible assets, or cryptocurrencies.
* **Data Persistence:** We do not guarantee the permanent persistence of your data. Balances or portfolios may be reset in the event of critical bugs, necessary economy rebalancing, or major version updates.
* **Fair Play:** We reserve the right to ban users, blacklist servers, or wipe specific user data if we detect:
    * Exploitation of bugs (e.g., infinite money glitches).
    * Use of automation (macros/self-bots) to farm activity.
    * Market manipulation via coordinated spamming.

## 3. Availability and Termination

* **Service Uptime:** We strive for high availability but do not guarantee that the Bot will be online 100% of the time.
* **Termination:** We reserve the right to revoke access to the Bot for any user or server at our sole discretion, particularly for violations of these Terms or the Discord Terms of Service.

## 4. Disclaimer of Warranty

The Bot and its source code are provided "AS IS", without warranty of any kind, express or implied. The developers are not liable for any damages, data loss, or server disruptions arising from the use of this software.

## 5. Contact

For questions regarding these terms, to appeal a ban, or to report a bug, please join our https://discord.gg/Sy2mqyNvBT or contact the developer directly.
